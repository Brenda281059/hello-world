Hi Humans!

Covid lockdown brought earth to a standstill. Time stopped. Humans looked around in their isolation and found only themselves staring back at them with eyes filled with fear. Then it dawned on them, that this was their time to achieve anything they wanted to. A time to fullfil past and present aspirations. Time was no longer of any consequence to a select few of these humans. As one of these humans, I turn back time to pursue a path that once eluded me. I am South African, an author, I speak four earthly languages and now I strive to learn the language of our future masters.
